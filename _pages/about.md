About Me
========

I've been working as a software developer for almost a decade. 
In that time, I have worked with a variety of different clients and technolgoies ([see below](#techStack)). 
I currently work in the Fintech space, and love creating solutions that help people improve their financial lives. 
I have also previously worked in the healthcare space, which is another passion of mine.

As a developer, I have a full stack experience with a front-end focus - my goal is to create awesome user experiences 
backed by well-written, scalable apps. Clean, easy to read code = ❤

I love collaborating! In my current role, I work closely with designers, product owners and fellow developers.

Outside of work, I am an avid reader 📚, enthusiastic crafts person 🧶 , amateaur cook 🌱 and an overall "creator" - I 
love working with my hands and making things.

As a software developer, I work mostly in JavaScript land. These are the frameworks and tools I know and love:

👩🏾‍💻   As I focus on Front End Development, I mostly work with **React.js, Redux and Node.js** to create clean, 
scalable web applications. Recently, I've been spending a lot of time working with **Next.js** which is great for 
**server side rendering** React apps and making them more SEO friendly.

For styling, I prefer to use **Sass** where I can, though I have used Less and just pure CSS in past projects.

📱 For mobile development, I currently use **React Native**, though I am always looking to learn more frameworks in this space! 🙂

I've worked mostly with relational databases using everything from MS SQL Server and Postgres to MySQL.

No developer's stack is complete without **npm / yarn and git** .
